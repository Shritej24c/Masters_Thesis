# Modeling Human Balance and Gait through Reinforcement Learning                

My Master's project on Balance and Gait in Humans(involving Computational Neuroscience and Deep Reinforcement Learning)

Implemented DDPG algorithm to model the healthy adult's postural sway characteristics by assuming human as a inverted pendulum (a simplistic mechanical model) with 1 degree of freedom and producing optimum torque to balance it with respect to the vertical.

The whole review of the project can be found in "Thesis_shritej.pdf" and "DDP_Review.pdf".

Environment for an inverted pendulum developed by using OpenAI Gym

Stable Baselines was used for RL agent (DDPG)
