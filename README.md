# Q_Pendulum
My Master's project on Balance and Gait (involving Computational Neuroscience and Deep Reinforcement Learning)

Implemented DDPG algorithm to model the healthy adult's postural sway characteristics by assuming human as a inverted pendulum (a simplistic mechanical model) with 1 degree of freedom and producing optimum torque to balance it with respect to the vertical.

The whole review of the project can be found in "Thesis_Shritej.pdf" and "DDP_review.pdf".

Environment for an inverted pendulum developed by using OpenAI Gym
Stable Baselines was used for RL agent (DDPG)
